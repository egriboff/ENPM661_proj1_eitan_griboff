# ENPM661_proj1_eitan_griboff

Implementation of 15-puzzle problem using different moves and a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to solve the problem.
This project takes an initial state, performs the necessary moves to reach the final state, and then prints the states needed to reach the final state in nodePath.txt 

To run this program the following Python packages must be installed:

JSON - Needed for writing the states into the text file

COLLECTIONS - Needed for the deque funtionality when working with the queue data structure
